Pedestrian-Model-Evaluation

Considering the fact that there is almost no general quatitative validation benchmark for pedestrian model, we formulate a pedestrian model evaluation framework using the trajectories from repeated experiments.


With the code, we formulate a framework or benchmark for quantitatively evaluating a pedestrian model by comparing the trajectories in simulations and in experiments. Note that an essential condition for the application of the evaluation framework is the identical or at least basically symmetric starting point and destination point for the participants in the repeated experiments.


We have four types of indexes here, including macroscopic fundamental diagram index, microscopic trajectories index, static distribution indexes (i.e., route length distribution index, travel time distribution index and speed distribution index) and dynamic time-series index (i.e., starting position distance time-series index, destination position distance time-seiries index and speed time-series index).
