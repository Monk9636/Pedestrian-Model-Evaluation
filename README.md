Pedestrian-Model-Evaluation
Considering the fact that there is no quatitative benchmark for pedestrian model validation, we formulate a pedestrian model evaluation framework using the original trajectories of repeated experiments.
With the code, we'd like to formulate a framework or benchmark for quantitatively evaluating a pedestrian model by comparing the trajectories in simulations and in experiments. Note that an essential condition for the application of the evaluation framework is the identical or at least symmetric starting point and destination point for the participants in the repeated experiments.
